# Pendu_Game--procedural_version
A "Pendu" game to play french Pendu. 
A name is asked when the program launches to save your score as and when games played and compare your scores to other players. 
All words asked are in the file './words.txt' (one word by line). 
The score works as follow: you have 8 fails given, the points you earn are the remaining fails when you find the word. 
So if you find the word, you win between 1 and 8 points, if you loose, you win 0 points. Simple.

Have a nice play !
